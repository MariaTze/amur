            <h2>International Partnerships</h2>
            <p>From 2001 onward, Russia’s Land of the Leopard National Park has worked hand-in-paw with China’s Northeast Tiger and Leopard Ecosystem Alliance to unify patrols, share camera-trap data, and coordinate anti-poaching training. In 2012, both governments formalized this cooperation by creating the Amur Leopard and Tiger Transboundary Reserve—connecting Land of the Leopard NP with China’s Hunchun Nature Reserve—and boosting cross-border ranger exchanges and joint enforcement operations. These efforts have driven a <strong>70% reduction in snaring incidents</strong> along the border.</p>

            <p>International NGOs such as WWF, Panthera, and the Wildlife Conservation Society support technical surveys, corridor mapping, and community outreach under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere framework. Annual “Leopard Summits” rotate between Vladivostok and Jilin City, bringing together scientists, park managers, and local stakeholders to align objectives. By synchronizing policy, field work, and educational programs across two nations, these partnerships set a global benchmark for big-cat conservation.</p>

        <article id="breeding">
            <h2>Breeding &amp; Reintroduction</h2>
            <p>Since 2010, the Global Cat Alliance’s captive-breeding program has produced over <strong>20 genetically valuable cubs</strong>. Each individual undergoes rigorous health screenings and genetic assessments to ensure maximal diversity before release, making this one of the most successful big-cat breeding initiatives in the world.</p>

            <p>To date, a dozen of these leopards have been reintroduced into carefully selected forest reserves. Post-release monitoring shows these individuals have established territories and contributed to a <strong>15% increase</strong> in the estimated wild population, demonstrating the program’s tangible impact on Amur leopard recovery. </p>
        </article>

        <article id="community">
            <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
            <p>Conservation NGOs have partnered with local communities to launch <strong>eco-tourism cooperatives</strong>, training guides and creating homestays that showcase Amur leopard habitat. This alternative income stream gives villagers a direct stake in protecting wildlife.</p>

            <p>Alongside tourism, a <strong>livestock-insurance scheme</strong> compensates farmers for losses due to leopard predation. In pilot areas, this has reduced retaliatory killings by over <strong>40%</strong>, fostering coexistence and local support for conservation efforts.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="restoration">
            <h2>Habitat Restoration</h2>
            <p>In partnership with regional forestry departments, conservation teams have replanted over <strong>20,000 hectares of native pine and birch</strong>, converting degraded lands back into suitable leopard habitat. Alongside reforestation, they’ve installed <strong>wildlife overpasses</strong> and underpass tunnels on major logging and highway routes to maintain safe movement corridors.</p>

            <p>Early monitoring results are promising: camera traps and GPS‐collared leopards confirm that individuals are using these restored corridors to expand their territories into previously isolated forest patches, improving genetic exchange and access to prey.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="policy">
            <h2>Policy &amp; Advocacy</h2>
            <p>Recent amendments to Russia’s Wildlife Protection Act increased maximum penalties for trafficking big-cat parts to <strong>15 years in prison</strong> and significant fines, signaling stronger government resolve against illegal trade. These enhanced sanctions have led to a measurable uptick in successful prosecutions, disrupting several trafficking networks in the Amur region.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, China’s updated Forestry Law now imposes <strong>hefty fines</strong> and potential business closures for illegal logging within designated big-cat corridors. Together, these legislative advances create a stronger policy framework that underpins on-the-ground conservation, making it harder for poachers and loggers to operate with impunity and ensuring vital habitats remain protected.</p>
